我已经复现了La Morgia论文中的方法.

I have successfully replicated the RF methods described in the La Morgia paper. 

but the results is different 

I also tried another method called LSTM-AutoEncoder.

An autoencoder learns two functions: 

- an encoding function that transforms the input data, 
- and a decoding function that recreates the input data from the encoded representation.

Question

- Can I use the same content from the project plan in my final dissertation?
- Is it necessary to split the dataset? as there are only 317 pump events.
- Can I leave Bristol earlier, around mid-August or late August?
